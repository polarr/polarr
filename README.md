Hi! I'm polarity, a 16 y/o from Canada interested in Math and CS.

I'm mainly focused on fullstack Web Development, but also dabble with Algorithmics and Computer Graphics.

I co-founded [Math et al](https://mathetal.netlify.app), a STEM organization hosting events and providing resources for students to learn and have fun. We launched [Virtual Olympiad](https://github.com/polarr/virtual-olympiad), an online multiplayer practice platform for competition math. It allows users to host highly customizable practice contests using questions from past contests and compete against friends.
