Hi! I'm polarity, also known as TropicoMango, a 16 y/o from Canada interested in Math and CS.
I mainly do Web Development, as well as some Algorithmics and Computer Graphics.

I co-founded [Math et al](https://mathetal.org), a STEM organization hosting fun contests, events, and providing resources for students to learn and enjoy the sciences.
