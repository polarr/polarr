Hi! I'm polarity, a 16 y/o from Canada interested in Math and CS.
Regarding CS, I'm mainly focused on Web Development but also dabble with Algorithmics and Computer Graphics.

I co-founded [Math et al](https://mathetal.netlify.app), a STEM organization hosting fun contests, events, and providing resources for students to learn and enjoy the sciences.
